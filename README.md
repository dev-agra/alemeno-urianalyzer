This assignment solution is implemented with Django and JavaScript, here front-end is a very basic form for inputting a image which is sent to the backend 
for processing with a DRF API, all relevant library requirements are placed in the .txt file. The endpoint for processing the image is 'process_image',
the webapp is deployed and hosted on render with github repository conected with it that re-deployes the project whenever a new commit is made.
Other deployment schems like Docker with EC2, Nginx proxy were not used as the deployment is only for demonstration purposes.
The webapp is deployed on the url: https://alemeno-urianalyzer-assign.onrender.com/
